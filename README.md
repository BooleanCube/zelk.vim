# zelk.vim
## one of my very minimalistic colorschemes
Zelk.vim is a blue themed colorscheme that I have been creating and editing for neovim, and this theme was mainly inspired by schnensch. This was designed to be a very minimalistic theme which is smooth and relaxing for the eyes.

### Installation

Installing the full colorscheme can be done in any plugin manager, if yours is not listed just search up how to install plugins using that plugin manager.
