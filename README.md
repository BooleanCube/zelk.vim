# zelk.vim
## very minimalistic and smooth colorscheme
Zelk.vim is a blue themed colorscheme that I have been creating and editing for neovim, and this theme was mainly inspired by schnensch. This was designed to be a very minimalistic theme which is smooth and relaxing for the eyes.

### Status Line Integration

*Note: As of now, this theme only supports lightline and doesn't have a theme ready for other status lines yet.*

<details>
  <summary>Lightline</summary>

1. First of all, you want to make sure you have [lightline](https://github.com/itchyny/lightline.vim) installed (and [lightline-bufferline](https://github.com/mengelbrecht/lightline-bufferline) is optional which adds the top bufferline).
2. Make sure in your lightline settings that should have come from their documentation (you can use [mine](https://github.com/BooleanCube/dotfiles/blob/main/config/nvim/init.vim) as an example) has the colorscheme component and put `zelk` in that component. Example:
```vim
let g:lightline = {
      \ 'colorscheme': 'zelk',
      \ 'active': {
      \   'left': [ [ 'mode', 'paste' ],
      \             [ 'gitbranch', 'readonly', 'filename', 'modified' ] ]
      \ },
      \ 'component_function': {
      \   'gitbranch': 'FugitiveHead'
      \ }
      \ }
```
3. If you installed lightline-bufferline, then read their documentation to mess around with some more but here is an example:
```vim
let g:lightline = {
      \ 'colorscheme': 'zelk',
      \ 'active': {
      \   'left': [ [ 'mode', 'paste' ],
      \             [ 'gitbranch', 'readonly', 'filename', 'modified' ] ]
      \ },
      \ 'component_function': {
      \   'gitbranch': 'FugitiveHead'
      \ },
      \ 'tabline': {
      \   'left': [ ['buffers'] ],
      \   'right': [ ['close'] ]
      \ },
      \ 'component_expand': {
      \   'buffers': 'lightline#bufferline#buffers'
      \ },
      \ 'component_type': {
      \   'buffers': 'tabsel'
      \ }
      \ }
```
